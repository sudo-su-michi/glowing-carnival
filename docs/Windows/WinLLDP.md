# WinLLDPService

WinLLDPService is free, open source and tiny Windows service. It sends Windows’ machine network information via LLDP so that network administrators can find computers or network-devices with ease. See also SNMP as it’s often used to gather more detailed information from network devices.

WinLLDPService acts only as an announcer to the switch (sends packets to the switch). It will not query switches’ internal LLDP data.

Possible errors are logged to Windows Event Log.



## Download & Installation

You can download WinLLDP from it's [Offical Github](https://raspi.github.io/projects/winlldpservice/).
